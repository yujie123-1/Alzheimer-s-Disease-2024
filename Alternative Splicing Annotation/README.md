# The principle of different alternative splicing events discovered by LeafCutter.
LeafCutter gathers all mapped reads in a study and detects overlapping introns indicated by split reads. Next, it builds a graph linking all overlapping introns with shared donor or acceptor splice sites. These interconnected sections of the graph create clusters, representing alternative intron excision events. 
LeafCutter can pinpoint different alternative splicing events, including
(1) exon skipping.
(2) 5’ or 3’ exon extension.
(3) complex splicing.
(4) exon skipping or alternative start or end.

# The principle of alternative splicing annotation.
the annotation is based on clusters. It involves three steps: 
* Checking chromosomal position of the cluster,
* Confirming if the base positions of the cluster overlaps exon start and end points
* Counting the number of unique base positions within the cluster. 
## The specific process is as follows:
If chromosomal position of each cluster falls outside the range of the human genome chromosomes, the annotation is "no alternative splicing event was found". 
If chromosomal position is within human genome range, and base positions within the cluster overlap exon start and end points, we count the unique base positions number of this cluster. If the number is greater than 3, the AS event of this cluster is annotated as "complex splicing"; if it is less than or equal to 3, it is annotated as "5’ or 3’ exon extension".  
If base positions within the cluster don't overlap exon points, and the unique base positions number in this cluster is equal to 4, the AS event is annotated as "exon skipping"; if it is not equal to 4, it is annotated as "exon skipping or alternative start or end event". 
## The files involved in the annotation process:
* Human exon information file
which should look something like this:
'''swift
gggg
'''
* Intron clustering file generated by LeafCutter.
which should look something like this:
